# What is this?
This is a simple web-tool to convert values between the most important number systems *(Decimal, Binary and Hex)*
This is also my first project using JS in combination with HTML and CSS.

# Features
- fast calculation directly on input
- theme-switcher
- *probably the best looking dec-bin-hex converter :D*

# Planned Features
- native backgrounds instead of images

# Known Issues
*There are currently no known issues*
