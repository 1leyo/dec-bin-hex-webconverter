# ✨ Note from 2025 
This is a small project I made during my first or second semester at university. I'd definitely do a bunch of things differently nowadays, but I still think it's a fun little tool that's worth keeping online. I made a few tweaks here and there afterwards as I continued learning and improving my skills, but I'll try to leave it as-is from now on — just to have something to look back on.  
_(Also, this was my first time using JavaScript!)_

# Original README.md
# What is this?
This is a simple web-tool to convert values between the most important number systems *(Decimal, Binary and Hex)*
This is also my first project using JS in combination with HTML and CSS.

# Features
- fast calculation directly on input
- theme-switcher
- *probably the best looking dec-bin-hex converter :D*

# Planned Features
- native backgrounds instead of images
- responsive layout with better view on mobile devices

# Known Issues
- bad readability on light theme
